# Fundamentals of Data Analysis Assignment

## Introduction

This repository contains two Python Jupyter notebooks. The first takes a look at the matplotlib.pyplot Python package, while the second imports and analysis data from the CAO for the years 2018-2021. The folders contain files that were saved from corresponding notebooks, and in the case of the pyplot notebook, there is a spreadsheet in the pyplot folder that is loaded to the notebook and necessary for the code to run.  

A rendered version of both the pyplot and CAO notebooks can be viewed using nbviewer:

CAO - https://github.com/andrewjscott/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Assignment/blob/main/cao.ipynb     

This repository is part of an assignment for the module Fundamentals of Data Analysis, for the course HDip in Computing in Data Analytics in GMIT. The assignment overview is as follows: 

> #### Instructions
>The purpose of this assessment is to ensure that you have achieved the learning outcomes
>of the module while also providing you with sample work to show prospective
>employers. The overall assessment is split into the three components as detailed below.
>The percentages beside each bullet point indicate the weighting of that item in your
>overall mark. Note, however, that the examiners’ overall impression of your submission
>may override the individual weightings where deemed appropriate.     
> #### GitHub Repository     
>Create a GitHub repository containing two Jupyter notebooks – these are described
>further down. The repository should contain the following:     
>10% A clear and informative README.md explaining why the repository exists, what is
>in it, and how to run the notebooks.     
>10% A requirements.txt file that enables someone to quickly run your notebooks
>with minimal configuration. You should also include any other required files such
>as data files and image files.       
> #### Pyplot Notebook     
>Include a Jupyter notebook called pyplot.ipynb that contains the following.     
>15% A clear and concise overview of the matplotlib.pyplot Python package,
>pitched at your classmates.    
>25% An in-depth explanation of three interesting plots from the matplotlib.pyplot
>Python package. You have free reign to choose the three plots yourself.     
> #### CAO Points Notebook     
>Include a Jupyter notebook called cao.ipynb that contains the following.     
>10% A clear and concise overview of how to load CAO points information from the
>CAO website into a pandas data frame, pitched as your classmates.     
>20% A detailed comparison of CAO points in 2019, 2020, and 2021 using the functionality
>in pandas.      
>10% Appropriate plots and other visualisations to enhance your notebook for viewers.

## To rerun the analysis on your machine

1. Install Anaconda - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual   
- Alternatively, if you already have Python installed and do not wish to install Anaconda, you can download the requirements.txt file and run pip3 install -r requirements.txt   
2. Open command terminal. If using windows it is recommended to install Cmder - https://cmder.net/ 
3. Download this repository with the following command using the command line - git clone https://github.com/andrewjscott/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Assignment.git
4. Enter the following command on command line to open Jupyter, will then open in your web browser - jupyter lab
5. In the Jupyter tab that opens in your browser, navigate to the to the notebook you wish to run and open
6. Click on Run and then click on Restart Kernel and Run all cells.
