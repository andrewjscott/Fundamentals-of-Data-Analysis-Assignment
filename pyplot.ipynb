    "From pyplot documentation - matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In matplotlib.pyplot various states are preserved across function calls, so that it keeps track of things like the current figure and plotting area, and the plotting functions are directed to the current axes (please note that \"axes\" here and in most places in the documentation refers to the axes part of a figure and not the strict mathematical term for more than one axis).\n",

    "Note - the pyplot API is generally less-flexible than the object-oriented API. Most of the function calls you see here can also be called as methods from an Axes object. We recommend browsing the tutorials and examples to see how this works.\n",

While this stateful interface is fast and convenient for simple plots, it is easy to run into problems. For example, once the second panel is created, how can we go back and add something to the first? This is possible within the MATLAB-style interface, but a bit clunky. (p. 223)\n",

In general, we suggest to restrict pyplot to interactive plotting (e.g., in a Jupyter notebook), and to prefer the OO-style for non-interactive plotting (in functions and scripts that are intended to be reused as part of a larger project).\" - https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/usage.html\n",

    "The following introductory text was written in 2008 by John D. Hunter (1968-2012), the original author of Matplotlib. - Matplotlib is a library for making 2D plots of arrays in Python. Although it has its origins in emulating the MATLAB graphics commands, it is independent of MATLAB, and can be used in a Pythonic, object oriented way. Although Matplotlib is written primarily in pure Python, it makes heavy use of NumPy and other extension code to provide good performance even for large arrays.\n",

As such, it’s convention and recommended to import pylot instead.\n",
